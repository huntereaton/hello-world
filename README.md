Hello everyone,

Today we will be talking about how to deal with the inadequicies of others in our daily lives. What we will realize along the way is that most of these "inadequacies" of other people that bother us, are really the traits or behaviors they have that refelct our own traits or behaviors we wish we didn't have. In short, what we hate about ourselves. 

Self-loathing can be a positive state as it attracts people to you in an unusual way and makes you mysterious. However, at the root of this remains the problem that we don't like ourselves and while we don't always get along with other people, the worst thing in the world to us is to be totally exiled and alone.

More tomorrow.
